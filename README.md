# Kegscales - device

## Summary

Micropython for the RaspBerry Pi Pico Kegscales project

## Project Outline
The kegscales project is attempting to create a replacement for the soon to be defunct Plaato Keg.
The project aims to create a device that can measure how much beverage remains in a keg using easily 
available components and a 3d printed enclosure.

The project currently consists of the Raspberry Pi Pico communicating over BLE with an android app

## This Repository
This repository contains micropython code to be installed onto a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller.

### Installation
First you need to download the micropython runtime from here 
  
https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html

Then use your preferred micropython dev system (Thonny, PyCharm etc) to push the code onto the board.
